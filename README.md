## October 1
In last Thursday's class, my partner and I focused on refining the wheel setup for our project. Initially, we had two larger wheels attached, and during this session, we worked on adding two smaller wheels. Itâ€™s crucial to maintain a bit of wobble in the board to prevent it from getting stuck during the performance. However, the smaller wheels were too short, so we decided to cut small wooden spacers to fit between the wheels and the board, raising the wheels to the right height.

Unfortunately, we miscalculated the length of the wooden spacers, and the board ended up sitting evenly on all four wheels, which eliminated the necessary wobble. To fix this, we removed one of the wheels and replaced the wooden spacer with a smaller piece, creating the imbalance we need.

Throughout the process, we used screws to attach everything securely, making pilot and through holes where needed. Looking ahead, our plan for the next class is to add the wires and start the soldering process.
