Character Description: Detective Hawk likes to pretend he knows what he is doing, clearly being inspired by watching too much Sherlock Holmes. He usually thinks out loud by talking to his sock puppet ‘Mr. Wright’. He finds clues by sheer luck and makes incorrect assumptions all the time even when it's obvious to the audience. When he interviews the suspects, he asks irrelevant questions. He is just lucky that they slip up.

Detective Hawk rocks a trench coat, mustache, and fedora. He also has a sock puppet sidekick on his hand that he talks to.

Construction Considerations: The sock puppet on his hand should be able to move to simulate talking. The detective's mouth should also be able to move. I think it would be possible using a motor that moves back and forth for the sock puppet. We are currently unsure about how to make the mouth move for the detective.

Rama and I met up in the IM Lab to work on building the base of our robot. We started first by using a ruler and pencil to find the middle of board. ![IMG_4399](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec5b4ab-6df1-49ff-89f5-e132e0c16d1b)

Then we installed the metal brackets to the motors by following the examples that the other students made. The wheels were also easy to instal to the motor using nuts and bolts from the lab.

Next we started drilling holes into the wooden board to give space for the nuts and bolts. We found this kind of challenging and ran into some small complications (the drill bit snapped in half), but we were able to successfully get it done.

Lastly, we installed the motors with the wheels onto the wooden board with M4 nuts and bolts.![IMG_4403](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9d5e252-15f3-4112-b50e-fe5b5c665feb)

In last Thursday's class, my partner and I focused on refining the wheel setup for our project. Initially, we had two larger wheels attached, and during this session, we worked on adding two smaller wheels. It’s crucial to maintain a bit of wobble in the board to prevent it from getting stuck during the performance. However, the smaller wheels were too short, so we decided to cut small wooden spacers to fit between the wheels and the board, raising the wheels to the right height.[

Unfortunately, we miscalculated the length of the wooden spacers, and the board ended up sitting evenly on all four wheels, which eliminated the necessary wobble. To fix this, we removed one of the wheels and replaced the wooden spacer with a smaller piece, creating the imbalance we need.

Throughout the process, we used screws to attach everything securely, making pilot and through holes where needed. Looking ahead, our plan for the next class is to add the wires and start the soldering process.

Questions : How do we define a human? Is it a soul? A body? Can it be recreated? What is the one essential differernce between a human and a robot? Why can a robot never become a human? Is it due to the lack of soul?

## Hat Movement:
The detective’s hat is designed to move up and down using a small servo motor. This feature triggers when the robot says certain phrases, adding an animated effect that brings the character to life.

## Eyeball Animation:
The detective’s eyes, equipped with Neopixel LEDs, not only move around but also look down at the puppet when it speaks. This gives the impression of real interaction between the detective and its puppet companion.
## LED Eye Emotions: 
The LEDs in the detective’s eyes change colors to express different emotions. For example, the eyes might glow red when the detective is serious or blue when in deep thought, providing an additional layer of emotional depth.
## Puppet Jaw Movement: 
A motor in the puppet’s jaw opens and closes its mouth, synchronized with its speech, as if it’s genuinely engaging in conversation with the detective.
